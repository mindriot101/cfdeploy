# cfdeploy

**This repository is archived since I learnt that `aws cloudformation deploy` exists***

Helps manage cloudformation stacks from the command line.

Performs two commands:

* deploy -> deploy a stack
* undeploy -> undeploy a stack

This abstracts over the difference between creating and updating stacks, as well as showing change sets (like
terraform).
